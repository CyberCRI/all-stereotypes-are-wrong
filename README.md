# Beliefs and Stereotypes - India Edition

**Beliefs and Stereotypes - India Edition** is a fork of [**All Stereotypes Are Wrong**](https://github.com/iwazaru/all-stereotypes-are-wrong), which was made in 48 hours by 
[Alexis Moroz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexismoroz) (game design) & 
[Cl√©ment Bourgoin](https://twitter.com/ClementBourgoin) (code) during the 
Diversity Jam (April 15-17, 2016) hosted at Mozilla Paris.

This fork is adapted to Indian stereotypes, and makes minor improvements in the gameplay.
